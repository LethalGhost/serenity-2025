<body>
Here on Interpost Hague we proclaim the idea of a semi-full liberty in player's actions. Nonetheless, rules are needed to regulate everything more clearly. They are lax, although they do not grant you full on freedom

1. Don't kill for little to no reason. As an example: "But he was black!".
If someone tries to fuck up your shit you can still murder him in cold blood. For an example, if someone tries to steal something from your department without asking for permission or is just being a complete idiot (murderboner).

2. Keep the experience intact. While the server is indeed LRP being close to MRP so you don't get situations which happened during the last tests, don't use retarded names like "CUMEATERBIGDICK" or "Harry Potter From The SJW Writer". The admins will rename you, and if you keep the name, you'll be booted. Harsh? Maybe. I don't care. 

If someone is endlessly murderboning and has gone completely nuts, tell us about him in #ban-requests. Just ask one of the GM's/HA's to gain access.

2.1 Freedom of speech is something our server (and I believe every server should) really values and protects, and we're no exception to that. You can say anything you want...in OOC.
In IC, you can say anything, too, but we'd like you to keep it to a low level to not ruin it and the "experience" for others. This is NOW a rule.

3. Antagonists can and will be validhunted, and they are free to do anything they want with the exception of crashing the server. Go wild, go crazy, go absolutely bonkers.

4. Metagaming is strictly forbidden, as is metacommunicating in OOC or outside the game itself. Metacliques which might form will be thoroughly investigated and EVERYONE involved in them will be permabanned. Not repeating the example of a one known server.

Additional notes:
Use your grey matter to determine which things would go in line with the rules and which wouldn't.
The staff team is here to make the game more fun AND interesting instead of overlooking what you do.
Being a full-on dick is not recommended, but semi-allowed. Be a cool asshole instead.
We'd like to keep bureaucracy to a minimum, and thus all the admins, mentors, maintainers are handpicked. This DOES NOT extend to lore masters, though. Just ask a headmin.
